<h1> Read Me </h1>
</br>
<p>
Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
<br>
The divs and IDs help break up different sections of the webpage to easily assign different styling to them. The classes determine what that styling is going to be for each div. The spans change the text within the div.
</p>
<br>
<p>
What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
<br>
Alt text is displayed if the image isn't able to load so that the viewer can still make sense of the webpage. It's important that your alt text is descriptive enough so the viewer can imagine what the image looks like.

Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
<br>
The only thing I forgot was how to add the style to the page. I had to go back and re-read that.I had a small problem with the video embedding and it took me a couple of times but then I figured it out. I didn't need to reach out for help.
