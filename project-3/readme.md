<h1> Read Me - Rachel Holton-Burnett </h1>

<p> The border goes around the box, the margin is the relationship with the entire box on the page and the padding is the space between the border and the items inside the box. </p>

<p> Overall this pretty much made sense. I was able to figure out my problems pretty quickly </p>
