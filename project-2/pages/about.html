<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
<h2> My name is Rachel Holton-Burnett. </h2> I got married about a year ago and haven't changed my name with UM yet so it
  still shows my maiden name. I am 28 years old and have lived in Missoula for 10 years (I'm originally from Salt Lake City, Utah). I work full time
  at Allegiance Benefit Plan Management and take classes part time. I am pursuing my BA in Media Arts. </p>
<p>
I chose succulents because recently I have been collecting them and propagating them. I am hoping to sell them
if my propagating is successful over the winter. I love the varities of the different plants and think they are
all so unique and beautiful. Having some living things in my house makes me happy throughout the winter when
everything is covered in snow. You can learn more from many different websites but my favorite is <a href =http://www.sunshineandsucculents.com> Sunshine and Succulents. </a> </p>
