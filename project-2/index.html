    <h2> Supplies Needed for the Optimal Growing Environment </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> A container with a drainage hole at the bottom </li>
     <i>This is important so that the roots don't sit water. This will lead to the plant rotting.</i>

     <li> Well draining cactus soil </li>
     <i> Find soil that is speficially for cactuses. This has rocks, sand and perlite in it. Once again to assit with drainage. </i>

     <li>A sunny spot to place your pant in </li>
     <i> Succulents like a lot of sun. A window that gets a lot of sun during the day is perfect. Without enough sun the succulent will
       not thrive. Some succulents will just stretch out looking for sun and some of them will not survive at all. </i>
</br><img src="./images/6.jpg" alt="Succulents in a window where they are getting plenty of light" title="Succulents in a Window" width="700" height="500" />
      <li> Only water the succulent when the soil is completely dry. In the Spring and Summer that might be once a week and in the
        Fall and Winter that might be every 10 days or so. </li>
        <i> It's best if you can let the soil dry out for a couple of days before watering again. </i>
