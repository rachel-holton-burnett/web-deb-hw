<h1> Read Me </h1>

Each page can have one head and one body.

The head includes the title which is shown in the tab and the meta data for your site.

The body includes everything that page will display. It's the core of the page.

Structural markup helps with the structure of the page. It helps divide up all the text into chunks so it's easier to read. This also makes the page easier to navigate as all of the text mashed together doesn't help organize the concepts of the page.

Semantic markup changes individual words. This helps identify words or smaller strings of text to pop out in the page.

The only issue I had on this project was the linking pages. It only took me a couple of times to figure it out. The code and structure is really coming back to me from my previous schooling and experience. However this class so far has been a great refresher on what needs to be done.
