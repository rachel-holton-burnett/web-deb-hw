<h1> Read Me - Rachel Holton-Burnett </h1>

<p> I chose simple sans serif fonts because that's what I like best. They are classic and easy to read. </p>
<p> A system font comes from your computer and unless you have it downloaded to your computer it won't show up, a web font can be downloaded into your
website files and therefore uploaded with your content and a web-safe font is a font that most browsers and computers can pick up easily. It's important
to have a fall back font incase the font you chose is not supported by the browser. </p>
<p>I picked colors for this assignment that went with the time that the Titanic sank. I didn't run into many difficulties with this project and enjoyed
seeing how the code was created for the example to give me a good idea how to structure everything. </p>
