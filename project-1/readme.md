<h1> Read Me for Project 1 </h1>

I use Chrome on my phone, my tablet and on my PC. I also use Chrome as much as I can at work but some of our web based apps have to be operated in Internet Explorer.

Browsers are able to take the HTML (or javascript) code and interept it into a a useable webpage with text and graphics.

I viewed a webpage from 1995. I remember when websites looked like that. Only blue, gray and black text and one font. It looks like it was just typed on a screen, there is nothing interacting with eachother. Now days every webpage has many colors, pictures and videos. Everything is cohesive and it looks like something more than just a newspaper.

The only issue I had on this assignment was putting the picture on the index. I wasn't sure if it needed to be part of the body or before/after the close HTML bracket. I eventually realized my mistake was in the spacing between img and src.

I was not able to attach a screen shot to this read me. I have the link correct and tried it in my image folder and outside of the image folder; neither seemed to work. 

I took web design courses in junior high and high school and used to customize my myspace page and a blog. This was all close to 15 years ago so it's slowing coming back to me. I started doing something that I always did back then; anytime I had code with the open bracket I automatically put a close one further down. This way I don't miss closing something and having a hard time locating it.
