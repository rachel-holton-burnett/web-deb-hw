# Read Me

A version control system allows users to make changes and upload them for storage. It then allows users to be able to revert back to previous changes if something ends up not working. We are using one in this class for that exact reason. As we build code then we can go back to previous documents if the code we create isn't working.

My [responses](./responses.txt)

My [screenshot](./images/holton-screenshot.PNG)

I did have some problems with this weeks assignment. At first I had too many spaces in link and between the description and the link. I also had trouble getting the screenshot to link and I'm not sure why. I was not able to get it correctly. 

I also had a difficult time with creating a list for the responses page but I reviewed the markdown list to see what happened.
