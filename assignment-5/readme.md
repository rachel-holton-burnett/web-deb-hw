<p> B: I chose the 1950s because I have always loved the colors and design elements from this decade. Much of my house and clothing is based off of this era.
I chose circles because I felt like dots were very much part of the aesthetic of that era. </p>
<p> C: My color palette is really bright and a good snap shot of colors for the era. I chose 4b7977, b46d6b, e0aa0c, and 7cc4b8.</p>
<p> D:I had a really hard time trying to get the picture to be centered in my page. Then I realized I could make an image division class instead of having it be part of the text container and that worked out much better. I was able to then adjust the proportions so that my container and image were centered together.Otherwise the formatting on the CSS sheet and then linking it to the page made sense to me. </p>
