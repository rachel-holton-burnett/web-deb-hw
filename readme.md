# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

I took this class because I learned web design when I was in junior high (over ten years ago now) and would like to learn it again. I always found it fasicnating and would like to re-learn the skills that I have since lost.

*I learned that the internet and the world wide web are two different things.

*People (myself included) use the term internet incorrectly as really it's just the wires that connect it.

*It is suprising to me that we think of the internet/world wide web being a wireless thing that connects everyone on a global level but really it's infrastructure is wires in the ground.
